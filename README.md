# Devbot Mod

_More information about the mod itself can be found on the [Software Inc Forum](http://softwareinc.coredumping.com/forum/index.php?topic=519.0)_

This repository houses the Devbot mod, which is a mod for the awesome game, [Software Inc](softwareinc.coredumping.com).

# Installation

For instructions on how to install the mod, please see [this guide](http://softwareinc.coredumping.com/forum/index.php?topic=258.0). Many people accidentally miss step 5, so make sure you do the same!

# Compatibility

The mod is currently targetted for Alpha 7-7, which at time of writing is the latest stable branch on Steam. If you have opted in to beta builds and subsequently running Alpha 8+, this mod will not work for you (yet!).

# Contributing

This mod was originally authored and located on [Smudge202's GitHub](https://github.com/smudge202). It is hoped that by locating the mod in a more generic, non-personal organisation, more people will be interested in getting involved and evolving this mod!

I understand that not all modders will be familiar with git[hub], so please follow these instructions (and google some git basics) in order to contribute:

1. Find an issue you want to work on (or raise an issue, ideally waiting for a go ahead before working on it!)
1. **Fork** the repository (Fork button on the repository home page - this will create your own copy of the repository on GitHub)
1. **Clone** your fork to your local machine (there's dozens of ways of cloning to your own machine, do it through git, not a zip download!)
1. Make sure you **Checkout** the correct branch. This will usually be the 'dev' branch!
1. Make changes on your local machine until the issue has been resolved (be it a new feature, a bug fix, etc).
1. **Commit** your changes, making sure you provide a useful commit message!
1. **Push** the changes back up to your Fork on GitHub
1. Navigate to your fork on GitHub, and create a **Pull Request** from the branch you worked on, to the dev branch in this repository
1. Use the `#123` syntax whereby the number is the issue number (or copy/paste the url for the issue if you prefer) in your Pull Request description to reference the issue you've addressed.
1. Wait for feedback or for your pull request to be accepted into the mod.
 
A couple extra tips and bits of info:

* Regular/good contributors will be added to the team!
* **All** contributors will be added to the authors list; please let me know what name you would like to appear on the forum post.
* The above flow sounds really complicated the first time you try it, the second time you'll do it in less than half the time. I find it takes me less than 2-3 minutes to completely run through the above process nowadays. ;)
